Looking into the inside, she saw several coats hanging up - mostly long fur coats. There
was nothing Lucy liked so much as the smell and feel of fur. She immediately stepped
into the wardrobe and got in among the coats and rubbed her face against them, leaving
the door open, of course, because she knew that it is very foolish to shut oneself into any
wardrobe. Soon she went further in and found that there was a second row of coats
hanging up behind the first one. It was almost quite dark in there and she kept her arms
stretched out in front of her so as not to bump her face into the back of the wardrobe. She
took a step further in - then two or three steps always expecting to feel woodwork against
the tips of her fingers. But she could not feel it.

"This must be a simply enormous wardrobe!" thought Lucy, going still further in and
pushing the soft folds of the coats aside to make room for her. Then she noticed that there
was something crunching under her feet. "I wonder is that more mothballs?" she thought,
stooping down to feel it with her hand. But instead of feeling the hard, smooth wood of
the floor of the wardrobe, she felt something soft and powdery and extremely cold. "This
is very queer," she said, and went on a step or two further.

Next moment she found that what was rubbing against her face and hands was no longer
soft fur but something hard and rough and even prickly. "Why, it is just like branches of
trees!" exclaimed Lucy. And then she saw that there was a light ahead of her; not a few
inches away where the back of the wardrobe ought to have been, but a long way off.
Something cold and soft was falling on her. A moment later she found that she was
standing in the middle of a wood at night-time with snow under her feet and snowflakes
falling through the air.
